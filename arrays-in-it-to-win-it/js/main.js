//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ["movie1", "movie2", "movie3"]

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstmovie=movies[0];
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let length=movies.length;

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let LastMovie = movies[-1];
